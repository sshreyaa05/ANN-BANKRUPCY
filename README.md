### Bankruptcy Prediction Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
### Overview:
In this project, we aimed to predict the likelihood of a company going bankrupt using a dataset containing financial features of companies. The dataset included various financial ratios and other relevant information. We applied an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify companies as either "Bankrupt" or "Not Bankrupt" based on these features. The ANN model was trained on a set of labeled data, and its performance was evaluated based on accuracy, which was a critical measure for determining the model's reliability.

### Results:
After training the Artificial Neural Network on the bankruptcy dataset, the model achieved an impressive accuracy of 93%. This result indicates that the ANN was able to correctly classify companies as bankrupt or non-bankrupt with high precision. The network's architecture was optimized to ensure that it could effectively learn from the features and make predictions that closely aligned with the actual outcomes.

### Conclusion:
The project demonstrated the effectiveness of Artificial Neural Networks in solving real-world classification problems, such as bankruptcy prediction. With a high accuracy of 93%, the ANN model was able to generalize well and predict bankruptcy status based on financial data. This approach highlights the potential of machine learning techniques, particularly ANN, to assist in financial forecasting and risk management, making it a valuable tool for decision-makers in various industries.
